# JavaScript DSA Notes

## Question: What is Data Structure ?
 > A Data Structure is a specific way of organizing, storing, and accessing data.

__Example Below__

## Algorithm
> A set of instructions that tells a computer how to do something,or you can also say step-by-step solution of the problem is called algorithm.

__Example Below__

![Algorithm](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/Algorithm.png)


__So in the above example I showed you what actually algorithm is and data structure__

```Keep in Mind``` 
> Algorithm is just a step by step solution for your problems and the array which contain persons name that is called data structure.

__You might be thinking why should I care about learning DSA__

* Well It has many Benefits Shown Below

__Main Motive To Learn DSA is you become Great Problem Solver__

```How do we know which code is good or bad and why should we care about it in realty there is no good or bad code but if you are applying for some sort of any job then interviwer will ask or wheather they ask what is your space complexity of your code or what is the time complexity of your code or what is the big 'O' of your code```

### What is Big O Notations ?

![Big O Notation](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/Big%20O%20Notation.png)

> Big O Notation helps us understand how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows

__When we combine time complexity and space complexity then we called Big O Notation. In Simple terms time complexity means how much time that algorithm would take to run and space complexity means how much space it was going to take to run this code__

__Understand Big O Notation with Real Life Analogy__

![Big O Analogy in Real Life](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/Big%20O%20Analogy.png)

(i) __First Big O Notation__

* __O(n)__ (Read As O of n)

![Definition Of O of n](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/O%20of%20n.png)

In Simple Words

![O of n Analogy](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/O%20of%20n%20Real%20LIfe%20Analogy.png)

Example

![O of n Example](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/O%20of%20n%20example.png)

* __Dropping the Constant's__

  Why O(2n ) is also called O(n) ?

![Real Life Ananlogy Part 2](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/Real%20Life%20Example%20O%20of%202n%20(Part%202).png)

* __O(1)__ (Read As O of one)

![Definition of O of 1](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/Defintion%20O%20of%20One.png)

Understand with Real Life Ananlogy

![Example of O of 1](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/Real%20Life%20Example%20of%20O%20of%20One.png)

Example in code

![Example code of O of 1](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/Example%20code%20of%20O%20of%201.png)

* __O(n^2)__ (O of n ^ 2)

![Defintion of O of n power 2](../DSA-with-JavaScript/assests/Definition%20of%20O%20of%20n%20Power%202.png)

Example
